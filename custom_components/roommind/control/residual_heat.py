"""Residual heat modeling for thermal mass (underfloor heating, radiators).

After heating stops, the thermal mass (floor screed, radiator body) continues
releasing stored energy into the room.  This module provides functions to
compute the decaying residual heat fraction so that the EKF and MPC can
account for it instead of mis-attributing the continued warming to solar
gain or insulation effects.
